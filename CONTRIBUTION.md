## Add New Prompt

> ⚠️ PLEASE INCLUDE YOUR PROMPTS IN BOTH THE `README.md` and `prompts.csv` FILES FOLLOWING THE GUIDELINES PROVIDED BELOW.

- If your prompt contains quotes, you must double-quote them to escape them in the CSV file.

      For instance: "She said, ""hi Amin"""
    Additionally, if your prompt includes a comma, double quotes should be added as well.

- The tags should be added as follow to the csv file:

  First tag-Second tag
- No spaces after commas after double quotes. e.g. `"Hello","hi"`, not `"Hello","hi"`

- If the prompt is generated by ChatGPT or any other language model such as Bard, please indicate this at the end of the contributors section, using the label `ChatGPT`.

- To add a new prompt to this repository you should take the following steps:

    1. Generate and validate the new prompt.
