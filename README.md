# Repository Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to enhance the prompts used for Chat GPT. By utilizing this dataset, researchers and developers can improve the performance of their Chat GPT models by incorporating more effective prompts. The objective is to achieve more consistent and contextually appropriate responses by providing the model with well-crafted prompts. This, in turn, can enhance the user experience and improve the overall performance of the system.

The dataset provided in this repository serves as a valuable resource for training and fine-tuning GPT API and improving chatgpt output.

The motivation behind creating this dataset stems from the fact that the output generated by Chat GPT can vary significantly based on the prompts used. In order to address this, I was inspired by the work showcased in [this](https://github.com/f/awesome-chatgpt-prompts) repo to compile a dataset that aims to improve the quality of user prompts and, consequently, enhance the overall output generated by the model.

In conclusion, this repository provides a valuable collection of prompts for Chat GPT that can be used to enhance the quality and consistency of the model's output. Through careful curation and evaluation, this dataset offers an opportunity to improve the user experience and promote advancements in conversational AI.

## Contribution
In this repository, you will find a variety of prompts that can be used with ChatGPT. We encourage you to [add your own prompts](https://github.com/Strikoder/PromptEngineering-ChatGPT/edit/main/README.md) to the list, and to use ChatGPT or any other LLM to generate new prompts as well.

> â„¹ **NOTE:** Sometimes, some of the prompts may not be working as you expected or may be rejected by the AI. Please try again, start a new thread, or log out and log back in. If these solutions do not work, please try rewriting the prompt using your own sentences while keeping the instructions same.


To get started, simply clone this repository and use the prompts in the README.md file as input for ChatGPT. You can also use the prompts in this file as inspiration for creating your own.

## Dataset Description
The datasets consists of three columns:
 1. Input: This column contains the prompts provided by users as input.
 2. Output: This column contains the corresponding best prompt that generates optimal output.
 3. Tags: This column includes tags or labels associated with each prompt.
